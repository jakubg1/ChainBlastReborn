# Chain Blast
This is a repository for **Chain Blast** - the game where you match chains together!

This is a project that runs on the [**LÖVE2D**](http://love2d.org/) framework and is currently designed to run on version **11.5**.

This project is based on the [**OpenSMCE**](https://github.com/jakubg1/OpenSMCE) engine.
It is based on an old version between Beta 4.8.0 and Beta 4.9.0. Upgrading would be a huge feat and as such it is currently not planned.

## Current Status
Currently, the game is in pre-alpha stage. There are several obviously missing features which are currently being worked on.

A first pre-alpha build is planned once a strong base for the game is done.

I didn't really want to publish the repository that early on, but I need to somehow show on my Github profile that I'm actually working on something so there's no extended dead period :]

## Contributions
Expect daily commits. If there are no commits in the period of a week, scold me in the Issues page, on Discord, or somewhere where I'll see the motivation to push the work forward. I don't accept the perspective of not finishing this project.

Before you contribute, ask yourself a question, *"is it okay if I sell your code as a part of a Steam release?"* If the answer is no, please don't contribute. I don't want to have any problems if the game somehow makes bucks.

If you're fine with that though, feel free to go ahead! Although I'd love to hear what are you planning in the first place, as it might clash with my vision for the game. And because it demotivates me when I just spill everything all over the place, I will keep my plans mostly secret until the game is actually close to being finished.

## Launching
Install [**LÖVE2D**](http://love2d.org/) first and launch the game as any other project.

## Screenshots
**Note that the game is in very early development. All visuals are subject to change and are incomplete.**
